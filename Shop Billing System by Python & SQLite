Shop Billing System (Python + SQLite)
About the Project

This project is a command-line based Shop Billing System built using Python and SQLite.
The main goal of this project is to understand how Python works with databases and how a real shop billing flow can be implemented logically.

The system allows managing products, creating bills for customers, reducing stock automatically, and storing sales data permanently.

This project was built step by step while learning Python and SQL.
